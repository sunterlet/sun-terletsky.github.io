## Hello!
Iâ€™m a PhD student investigating how the human brain navigates and represents space.  
My research focuses on:
- Disentangling egocentric (self-centered) and allocentric (world-centered) spatial perception.
- Using virtual reality (VR) tasks to explore how individuals encode and recall locations.
- Employing neuroimaging techniques (fMRI) to reveal the neural networks underlying spatial cognition.
